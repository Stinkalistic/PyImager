# PyImager
this is a custom image format I made in python where each pixel is stored as a python turtle graphics color string. To open a pyimg file, drag it into the same folder as pyimager.py and run pyimager and enter the name of the pyimg. you can create a pyimg file using pyimg creator but I would not recomend making big. press e to change pen color and press s to save
